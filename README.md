# string-compare
Solution for the string comparison coding challenge.

There's a good algorithm, and there's a better algorithm.

And there's a python script to show you why.

## Compilation:

'make'

## Execution:

The good algorithm: './good'

The better algorithm: './better'

The programs will prompt you for input.

Optionally, pass in strings as command line arguments:

'./good "string1" "string2"'

## Test script:
The test script runs each program several times on input strings of increasing lengths, and outputs the results to the command line.

'./test_runner.py'
